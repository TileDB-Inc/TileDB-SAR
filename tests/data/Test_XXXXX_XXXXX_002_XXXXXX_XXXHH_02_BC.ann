; Parameter file for UAVSAR stackline Test 
; intentionally created for testing uavsar parsing by this project
; search for parameters/value rather than placement in file
;
; slc = single look complex slant range image
; slc_mag and slc_phase are derived from the same 8 bytes per pixel of the slc input file, 
; where the first 4 bytes contain the real part of the complex data and the second 4 bytes contain the imaginary part of the complex data
;
; llh = latitude/longitude/dem height of each pixel in the slc
; LAT/LONG/HGT are packed as 3 floating point values per slc pixel (data order: lat1 lon1 hgt1 lat2 lon2 hgt2 ...)
;
; lkv = look vector at the target pointing from the aircraft to the ground, in ENU (east, north, up) components
; look vector ENU components are packed as 3 floating point values per slc pixel (data order: east1 north1 up1 east2 north2 up2)
;
; Peg position is the nadir position of aircraft at the middle of the datatake
; Projection of image is relative to the flightline (S - along track position, C - cross track position)
; S0, C0 is offset to upper left coordinate of SLC in meters
